She walks us through her career, what cyber security means to her, and what is most exciting and most terrifying about the field. Kristen served as IBM’s first chief global security officer and then went on to becoming a founder in the DC tech space. She is now CEO of BlueVector, a ‘network security [company] with state-of-the-art AI, sensing and responding to the world's most sophisticated threats in real time’.

We all know DC is a hub for people from ALL over the world (although let’s all be cognisant to not fall into the “no one is from DC trap”). With fantastic nightlife, a young vibrant population, lots of culture, and let’s face it, a ton of A type people who know how to network, moving to DC can be exhilarating and exciting to some and intimidating and terrible to others. I talk to 3 recent-ish transplants on how they found each other and made their homes in DC <script src="https://www.buzzsprout.com/108546/705284-sam-bays-kasey-randall-vincent-wanga-the-three-musketeers-of-design.js?player=small" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script></article><article class="index-page"><h2><a href="/posts/rosselleS/">Roselle Safran: The winding path</a></h2><p class="no-margin">Roselle Safran describes herself on twitter as ‘mother, entrepreneur, cybersecurity specialist, world traveler’. After my friend Amelia Friedman (season 1 episode 9) told me about Roselle I knew I wanted to hear her story. A background in science, blind applying for a job in whatever cyber forensics is, traveling the world, and starting her own company, Roselle seemed like a wonder woman… how did she get there, what has helped her be so successful, does she sleep?? Turns out Roselle is a pretty down to earth lady with an overwhelming urge to learn and experience. It always gives me joy to listen to how normal people get to extraordinary places... maybe that means we are all superwomen! <script src="https://www.buzzsprout.com/108546/684364-roselle-safran-the-winding-path.js?player=small" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script></article><article class="index-page"><h2><a href="/posts/burnout/">Rica Rosario, Dian Holton, Shannon Turner: It is time for a nap?</a></h2><p class="no-margin">Today we are going to talk about Burnout, specifically for community organizers and activists in tech.
