<p>DC Tech stories is a podcast chronicling the lives, passions, and narratives of technical workers in the DC Metro Area. A project started by Jessica Bell and Mitchell Shelton in January 2017. We brought on Rae Gaines in spring of 2017 to assit with post production audio work. The podcast aims to humanize the people who work in technical positions. Guests range from civic techies, to startup developers, bootcamp grads, to executives.<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/rJjvRAW5bcmI6K7g2">Nominate</a> someone to tell their story!</p>
