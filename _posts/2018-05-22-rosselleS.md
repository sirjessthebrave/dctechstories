<p class="no-margin">Roselle Safran describes herself on twitter as ‘mother, entrepreneur, cybersecurity specialist, world traveler’. After my friend Amelia Friedman (season 1 episode 9) told me about Roselle I knew I wanted to hear her story. A background in science, blind applying for a job in whatever cyber forensics is, traveling the world, and starting her own company, Roselle seemed like a wonder woman… how did she get there, what has helped her be so successful, does she sleep?? Turns out Roselle is a pretty down to earth lady with an overwhelming urge to learn and experience. It always gives me joy to listen to how normal people get to extraordinary places... maybe that means we are all superwomen!</p>
