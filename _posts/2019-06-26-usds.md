<p class="no-margin">The US Digital Service was created by Obama in August of 2014, USDS is a “startup at the White House  who’s focus is to bring together the best technology, design, and government talent.” USDS works on three critical national priorities: modernizing immigration, Veterans’ benefits, and HealthCare.gov.  Affectionally known as Obama’s nergs, today, they operate in Departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, and the Small Business Administration.  I bring in 4 USDS’ers to talk about what it’s like working in tech in the Government (its both not as bad and way worse than you think it is!). Here is my interview with Jordan Kaspar, Kristen Tran, Robbie Holmes, and Aileen Chen. ** Note this episode was recorded in Feburary 2018 **</p>
