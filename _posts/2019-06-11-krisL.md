<p class="no-margin">I had the chance to sit down with Kristen Lovejoy, a cyber security expert and founder here in DC. 
She walks us through her career, what cyber security means to her, and what is most exciting and most terrifying about the field.
Kristen served as IBM’s first chief global security officer and then went on to becoming a founder in the DC tech space. She is now CEO of BlueVector, a ‘network security [company] with state-of-the-art AI, sensing and responding to the world's most sophisticated threats in real time’.
