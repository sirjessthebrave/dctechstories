<p class="no-margin">Code for DC is a Code for America Brigade located here in Washington, DC. Founded in 2012, we are a a non-partisan, non-political group of volunteer civic hackers working together to solve local issues and help people engage with the city. We host twice-monthly hacknights and other events to gather, discuss, and get stuff done.  We're looking to bring people with all different skill sets together to maximize our potential. Civic hackers aren't just developersâ€”they're journalists, lawyers, designers, and interested citizens in general. The more community participation, the better.</p>

<p class="no-margin">The DC Abortion Fund is an all-volunteer, 501(c)(3) nonprofit that makes grants to pregnant people in the DC area, as well as those traveling to the area, who cannot afford the full cost of an abortion. They have been collaborating with Code for DC to get their intake system out of Excel and into a Rails app. Find them at <a href="www.dcabortionfund.org">www.dcabortionfund.org</a> or on Twitter at @DCAbortionFund</p>
