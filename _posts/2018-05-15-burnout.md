<p class="no-margin">Today we are going to talk about Burnout, specifically for community organizers and activists in tech. Most of us know that working in technology can be an exhausting job from keeping up with the latest trends, tools, and frameworks to the incessant client who wants ONE LAST THING before the deployment. And for the people who help to run meetup groups, organize events and coordinate conferences, sometimes it can feel like the work never ends! I brought in three of the most busy and accomplished organizers in DC: 
  <ul>
    <li>AIGA DC President and Senior UX Designer Rica Rosario,</li>
    <li>Hear Me Code Founder and teacher of hundreds of women Shannon Turner, and</li> 
    <li>AIGA DC Mentoring + Design Continuum Scholarship Fund Director and GDUSAâ€™s Person to Watch in 2016 Dian Holton</li>
  </ul>
